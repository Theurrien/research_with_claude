# Personal Research Assistant with Claude

Use Claude to search through your own Zotero and Readwise libraries and generate evidence-based answers from your notes and highlights.

## What's This About?

Instead of searching the web, this workflow lets Claude search through *your* research library—prioritizing your own notes and highlights over raw texts. You get answers based on what *you* already read and considered important, with full citations and a documented research process.

## What's in This Repo?

**`research_prompt.md`**  
The system prompt that teaches Claude to search your libraries systematically in 4 phases: semantic search → collection exploration → Readwise cross-reference → synthesis with citations.

**`writing_vs_speaking_learning_efficiency.md`**  
A complete example showing the workflow in action—including the research question, the search process, identified knowledge gaps, and the final synthesized answer with APA references.

## Requirements

- Claude Desktop App
- [Zotero MCP Server](https://github.com/54yyyu/zotero-mcp)
- [Readwise MCP Server](https://docs.readwise.io/readwise/guides/mcp)
- Your Zotero library with notes/highlights
- Readwise account (optional)

## Why This Matters

Building systems like this—connecting AI to your personal knowledge infrastructure through prompts and MCP servers—is becoming a key competency. You're not just using AI, you're architecting your own research environment.
